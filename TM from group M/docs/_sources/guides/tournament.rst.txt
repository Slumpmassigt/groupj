Tournament Manager
==================

.. highlight:: python

How it works
------------

The tournament manager is used like this.

.. code-block:: python

    # Create a new tournament manager
    tm = TournamentManager(create_game, run_game)

    # Show the main menu
    tm.start()

The TM shows the main menu where the user can choose which tournament type to play and how many players to include.
Once selected, the tournament starts and the games will be played.

Integration
-----------

To integrate the tournament manager with a game platform the following functions have to be passed to the ``TournamentManager`` constructor (see above).

.. code-block:: python

    def create_game(player1, player2):
        """
        Create a new game (using the game platform) and return it for later use.

        :param player1: First player (black)
        :param player2: Second player (white)
        :return: The created game object
        """
        pass


    def run_game(game, match):
        """
        Play the game and update the match result with ``match.finished(...)``.

        :param game: Game object previously created in create_game
        :param match: Current match object
        """
        pass

These functions are already implemented if you use Group M's game platform.
